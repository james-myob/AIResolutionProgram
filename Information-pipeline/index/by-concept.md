# Index — By Concept

> Every emerging concept introduced across daily briefings, with first-mention date, plain-English explainer, and chronological list of subsequent appearances. **Auto-generation not yet built — Mission 7 deliverable.** Until then, manually appended.

A concept earns an entry when the term is genuinely new in the discourse or being repositioned in a way that's catching on. Synonyms for existing concepts and ordinary product names don't qualify (see `prompts/editor-system.md` §"Concept tracking").

## `concept:text-diffusion-inference`
**First mention:** 2026-06-13

**Plain English:** A method of generating text by starting with a sequence of random "noise" tokens and iteratively refining all of them in parallel — the opposite of how GPT-style models work, which write text one token at a time left to right. Because all tokens are updated simultaneously in each pass, the model can produce 256+ tokens per step rather than one, yielding 4× or higher throughput on the same hardware. The quality trade-off is real: current text-diffusion models score lower than autoregressive models on knowledge and coding benchmarks, but they win on raw output speed. DiffusionGemma is the first major-lab production release of this approach.

## `concept:agent-dreaming`
**First mention:** 2026-05-21

**Plain English:** A scheduled, background memory-consolidation process that runs between an AI agent's active work sessions. While the agent is idle, a separate process reviews past task logs, extracts recurring patterns, surfaces lessons from previous errors, and writes consolidated memory notes — so the agent wakes up with that context already integrated next time. The name is an explicit analogy to how human brains consolidate memories during sleep. Functionally distinct from RAG-based memory (reactive, on-demand retrieval) or long-context storage: agent dreaming is proactive and periodic, running on a schedule without a human trigger. Anthropic's implementation in Claude Code is the first to productise this pattern as a first-class feature.

## `concept:agent-harness`
**First mention:** 2026-05-20

**Plain English:** The runtime layer that wraps an LLM with tools, memory, permissions, and loop control — the thing that turns a model into an agent. Distinct from the model itself: the harness handles "after the model says X, what tools does it have access to, what's its working memory, when does it stop?" Vendors are increasingly selling the harness as a product separate from the model (Claude Code, Codex, LangChain Deep Agents, Google's Antigravity), the way orchestration was sold separately from compute in earlier infra cycles.

**Origin:** V. Trivedy — *The Anatomy of an Agent Harness* ([vtrivedy.com](https://www.vtrivedy.com/posts/the-anatomy-of-an-agent-harness)). Reached named-product credibility in mainstream developer publications on 20 May 2026 ([NVIDIA Developer Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/)).
