# Index — By Concept

> Every emerging concept introduced across daily briefings, with first-mention date, plain-English explainer, and chronological list of subsequent appearances. **Auto-generation not yet built — Mission 7 deliverable.** Until then, manually appended.

A concept earns an entry when the term is genuinely new in the discourse or being repositioned in a way that's catching on. Synonyms for existing concepts and ordinary product names don't qualify (see `prompts/editor-system.md` §"Concept tracking").

## `concept:ai-pacing`
**First mention:** 2026-07-29

**Plain English:** A policy framing that reframes the "should we pause AI development" debate away from a binary stop/go decision and toward building a standing mechanism — metering tools, verification infrastructure, coordination channels — that could throttle the *rate* of frontier AI progress if it started outrunning human oversight capacity. Distinct from a "pause" (which stops now) or "safety testing" (which checks outputs): pacing is about pre-building the *capability* to slow down later, without committing to using it yet.

**Origin:** The "Pacing the Frontier" employee letter, signed by 1,100+ workers across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta — [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/07/29/openai-anthropic-endorse-call-government-pace-ai-progress/)

## `concept:agent-dreaming`
**First mention:** 2026-05-21

**Plain English:** A scheduled, background memory-consolidation process that runs between an AI agent's active work sessions. While the agent is idle, a separate process reviews past task logs, extracts recurring patterns, surfaces lessons from previous errors, and writes consolidated memory notes — so the agent wakes up with that context already integrated next time. The name is an explicit analogy to how human brains consolidate memories during sleep. Functionally distinct from RAG-based memory (reactive, on-demand retrieval) or long-context storage: agent dreaming is proactive and periodic, running on a schedule without a human trigger. Anthropic's implementation in Claude Code is the first to productise this pattern as a first-class feature.

**Origin:** Anthropic Code with Claude 2026 — [event page](https://claude.com/code-with-claude) · [MindStudio breakdown](https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/code-with-claude-2026-new-agent-features)

## `concept:agent-harness`
**First mention:** 2026-05-20

**Plain English:** The runtime layer that wraps an LLM with tools, memory, permissions, and loop control — the thing that turns a model into an agent. Distinct from the model itself: the harness handles "after the model says X, what tools does it have access to, what's its working memory, when does it stop?" Vendors are increasingly selling the harness as a product separate from the model (Claude Code, Codex, LangChain Deep Agents, Google's Antigravity), the way orchestration was sold separately from compute in earlier infra cycles.

**Origin:** V. Trivedy — *The Anatomy of an Agent Harness* ([vtrivedy.com](https://www.vtrivedy.com/posts/the-anatomy-of-an-agent-harness)). Reached named-product credibility in mainstream developer publications on 20 May 2026 ([NVIDIA Developer Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/)).
